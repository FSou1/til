# Debugging

> Fix the problem, not the blame

It doesn't matter if the bug is your fault or someone else's. It's still your problem.

Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.

The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducable.

> Failing test before fixing code

When you come across a surprise but, you need to determine why this failure wasn't caught earlier.

If you find yourself surprised by a bug, then probably there are assumptions that are wrong.

> Don't assume it - prove it

If it took a long time to fix this bug, ask yourself why. Is there anything you can do to make fixing this bug easier the next time around?
