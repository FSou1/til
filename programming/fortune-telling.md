# Educated guess vs Fortune telling

**TL;DR**. Instead of wasting effort designing for an uncertain future, you should design your code to be replaceable.

> Don't outrun your headlights

In software development our headlights are limited, we can't see too far ahead into the future.

> Take small steps - always

Always take small, deliberate steps, checking for feedback and adjusting before proceeding.

Try to stick educated guess, not fortune telling / wild speculation.

You can find yourself fortune telling when you have to

* Estimate completion dates in months
* Plan a design for future maintain/extend-abilities
* Guess user's future needs
* Guess future tech availability

But how are we supposed to design future maintenance? Only as far ahead as you can see.

ðŸ”¥ Instead of wasting effort designing for an **uncertain future**, you should design your code to be **replaceable**.

Making code replaceable will also help with cohesion, decoupling, and DRY, leading to a better design overall.

And at the end of the day, there's always the chance for a black swan around the corner.
