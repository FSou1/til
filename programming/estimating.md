# Estimating

TL;DR. What to say when asked for an estimate? **I'll get back to you**.

> Tip: Estimate to avoid surprises

To some extent, all answers are estimates. It's just that some are more accurate than others.

The units you use for estimation matter: compare 'about 130 days' and 'about 6 months'. '130 days' probably implies a higher degree of accuracy.

Recommendation:
* 1-15 Days
* 3-6 Weeks
* 2-6 Months
* 20+ Think hard before giving an estimate

A basic estimating trick that always gives good answers: ask someone who's already done it.

## Estimating project schedules

PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) - every task has an optimistic, a most likely, and a pessimistic estimate.

- How long will it take to paint the house?
- Well, if everything goes right, and this paint has the coverage they claim it might be as few as 10 hours. But that's unlikely: a more realistic figure is closer to 18 hours. And, ofc, if the weather turns bad, that could push it out to 30 or more.

## Eating the elephant (one bite at a time)

Practice incremental development, repeating the following steps with every piece of functionality:
* Check requirements
* Analyze risk (and prioritize riskiest items earlier)
* Design, implement, integrate
* Validate with the users

The refinement gets better and better each time, and you can refine your initial guess on the number of iterations.
